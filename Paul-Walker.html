    His Biography and His death
  </h2>
  <p>
    Paul Walker was born in the fall of 1973 in the family of a former boxer and model. His family since childhood<br>
    supported Paul's mother's desire to introduce the baby into the world of show business. When Walker was one and<br>
    a half years old, he had already managed to star in a diaper commercial.From an early age, Paul was a regular at the<br>
    castings to which his mother had taken him. The boy went to the catwalk and starred for clothing brands, then he got roles<br>
    in his first series. Parents were proud that their son appeared on the screen and on the catwalks, but Paul himself did not<br>
    particularly like the modeling business. At that time, he was very attracted to marine biology. He watched documentaries by<br>
    Jacques Yves Cousteau and dreamed of one day going to study the underwater world. Paul went on to graduate as a marine<br>
    biologist and was involved in developing projects and filming documentaries for National Geographic. As a child, Paul <br>
    independently made aquariums for fish. To some extent, Paul chose to act out of a sincere desire to prove to his <br>
    brothers that he was capable of succeeding in this area. Almost all the men in his family certainly became <br>
    representatives of traditional male professions: policemen, workers, construction. Paul's brothers often made fun of<br>
    their older brother, who had chosen a more sophisticated role, but Walker was in no hurry to 'give up.Even despite <br>
    the uncertainty and complexes that had settled his family's doubts in him, he decided to succeed in his chosen career,<br>
    and one day his dream came true.<br>

    In his youth, Paul was a light guy, passionate about surfing and fishing. He received a nickname from his friends, <br>
    which they think perfectly characterized the actor at that time: they all called him "The Tramp "However, that did <br>
    not stop Walker from taking his work seriously. movie theater. The 90s became a springboard for him, which helped<br>
    the future celebrity to rise to fame. He starred in Young and Restless and then in the comedy film Meet the Didles,<br>
    which brought him great popularity. One of the most memorable projects that Paul was working on at the time, Walker <br>
    himself considers the film Pleasantville, on the set of which he managed to work with Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon. <br>
    This film was followed by unsuccessful auditions for the Star. The Wars franchise and Paul's loudest, most popular<br>
    and brilliant project, which brought him not only triumphant popularity, but also decent fees - "Fast and Furious".<br>

    In the summer of 2001, the first picture appeared on the screens, on which neither the directors nor the performers<br>
    at first had any special hopes. Paul got the role of a positive character - a policeman with high moral qualities,<br>
    for which the audience loved him so much. On the screen, a friendship was born between Brian and Dominic, whom <br>
    Diesel embodied, and this friendship turned into a real affection that accompanied the actors for many years. <br>
    Vin and Paul have occasionally admitted in interviews that they treat each other like brothers. Diesel even named <br>
    his daughter after a friend - Paulina. A few years later, Paul starred in a sequel to the film, after which <br>
    he became the main character when Vin Diesel went to conquer fantasy films. Acting finally began to please Walker.<br>
    He often said he liked action movies - that way he felt more masculine and confident. However, Paul didn't stop<br>
    at action films: she also dabbled in a war movie and continued to study marine biology which fascinated him. Walker<br>
    started a charity that supports disaster victims. Paul not only sponsored the foundation, he went on expeditions <br>
    alone to help people. One of the actor's passionate hobbies was motorsport. He constantly participated in rallies<br>
    and races, being a good driver, however, ironically, it was this passion that killed Walker. In November 2013, he <br>
    drove home with his friend, who was driving a two-seater and at one point lost control. The passenger and driver <br>
    were killed instantly when they hit a concrete pole.Walker has a daughter, Meadow Rain, with ex-girlfriend Rebecca <br>
    McBrain. In his will, Walker left his $25 million estate to Meadow and requested that his mother become her legal<br>
    guardian.

    His Legacy - ROWW ( Reach Out WorldWide)
  </h2>
  <p>
    Reach Out WorldWide (ROWW) is a 501(c)(3) registered nonprofit founded by Paul Walker. In January of 2010, after<br>
    a massive earthquake devastated Haiti, Paul spontaneously organized a relief team that responded to the disaster.<br>
    On the trip, Paul saw a gap between the availability of skilled resources and the requirement for such personnel in<br>
    post-disaster situations. Upon returning from Haiti, ROWW was established with the purpose of fulfilling this unmet<br>
    need. ROWW continues to respond internationally to natural disasters worldwide ranging from earthquakes to <br>
    hurricanes. Our teams are small so that we can gather and deploy quickly. We pack efficiently so that we can carry <br>
    our gear into the most remote and desperate regions. These are the people that have been excluded from the media<br>
    attention and are too small or inconvenient for the larger non-profits to reach. It would have been far easier and <br>
    cheaper for Paul to put his face on an existing organization and check in from time to time, but he didn't. He chose<br>
    to get dropped off from a helicopter in Haiti, during a very unstable time, without a plan in hopes to <br>
    personally help those in need. He accomplished his goal and was hooked. Next, he shifted his schedule around to go <br>
    to aid those in need in Chile. Again he not only funded the trip but gave his own time. After a few more deployments<br>
    he was finally at peace with his profession as he knew it was allowing ROWW to exist.
